This is a little side project I've been working on for some time. It's intention is to merge my knowledge of all the little prototypes I've worked on previously.

Gmooh is a small little platform game for mobile.
The main features that are currently being work on are:
Level design;
Upgrade system;
Story system;
Side characters;
Gmooh's movement and interaction behavior.

Gmooh stands for Get Me Out Of Here, which was initially intended as the main project to use when applying for jobs, but it is also a bit of a word play with "Jeee", which is a japanese expression for staring at something intently. It is read as Jii-Moh, and tells the story of a little creature who has lived in the absence of light for all of its existence. That is, until a Light Source found him. Now, with the help of this Light, he seeks to leave the place he never left before.
